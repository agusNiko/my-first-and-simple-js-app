# my-first-and-simple-js-app
 
# Project description:
    A small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

# How to get the project running:
     open index.html in your browser 

# Project dependencies: 
     The project relies mostly on vanilla JavaScripts.

     A promise polyfill is included within the repository which is a piece of code that mimics newer JavaScript features for older browsers (in this case for promises).

     A polyfill for Touch Interactions via Pointer Events in safari is also included.

    Furthermore, bootstrap was also used to styling the project. To have access to the bootstrap version just check the branch “bootstrap”

# Which API the project uses
   The app fetches information from the Pokémon API: https://pokeapi.co/

# Note: 
	  The code between comments represent the code I use during the learning and development process of the app
